&lt;p&gt;This is actually my first blog post on any site, ever. Hopefully I can present some useful insights about working in open source, as well as new things I learn in Machine Learning. So what&amp;rsquo;s the point of this blog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introspection&#34;&gt;Introspection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point I&amp;rsquo;m shooting for here is for this to be a place for introspection about beginning work in open source. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time in industry working on various projects, but never taken the time to try to contribute to open source. I hope I can share my journey from having contributed nothing, to becoming a regular or semi-regular contributor to a few projects. If that works out then this site can be a record for others that want to get involved in open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently finished a Masters in Computer Science and I would really like to keep a bit of that research bent as I move forward in my career. It can be really easy to just fall into a pattern of wasting time and not really investing in your continued education as time goes by. I can certainly attest to that being my experience over the past 6-8 months since I graduated in May. As far as research, I hope to follow a number of different researchers in the ML community and write summaries of what I&amp;rsquo;m able to get out of the papers I read. For people other than me, I hope that these summaries can provide some insight into the current state of Machine Learning research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;readers-or-no-readers&#34;&gt;Readers or No Readers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really my concern with this blog, so in some ways I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing to myself. If there end up being followers, I hope that you will write in the comments to drive changes in my approach that can push me to support what a few others are interested in as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,
MN&lt;/p&gt;
